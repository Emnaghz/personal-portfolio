## Tools

In building this project, I harnessed the power of the following tools and technologies:

- **ThreeJS**: A robust 3D graphics library for rendering and animating the 3D model on the website.

- **React Three Fiber**: A popular React library seamlessly integrating with ThreeJS, simplifying the creation of stunning 3D graphics within a React application.

- **TailwindCSS**: A utility-first CSS styling framework for crafting a responsive and visually appealing design.

- **Framer Motion**: The go-to library for adding captivating animations to a React website, enhancing the overall user experience.

- **EmailJS**: Implemented email functionality through a form on the website using the EmailJS service, ensuring a convenient and reliable communication channel.

- **GitHub Actions**: Established a robust pipeline for building and deploying the website, automating the process and keeping the website up-to-date on GitHub Pages.
